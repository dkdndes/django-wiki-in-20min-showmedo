A version of the example source code of the showmedo video tutorial.

This version works with Django 1.4, with separate 'urls.py', 'base.html' 
with inheritance and 'no admin' functionality.

The tutorial explains the usage of 'views', 'forms' and 'base.html' (with template 
inheritance) without the usage of 'from django.forms import ModelForm'

Another alternative you could try out is 'form preview' in the Django tutorial 
and compare it with the example shown here.
